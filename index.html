        <p>
              This is the website for CS 499 Team #3. Check out the Bio's page for team member information.
              Our client is Mr. Peter Williams from North Oldham High School. Our project is to build a
              system for visually impaired and blind people to shoot basketball. The home page is a feed
              of log entries that will track progress. Each team member will write at least one log entry
              per week. To view each person's log entries, go to their respective page.

        <p>Welcome to my log feed. I will post a weekly log entry at a minimum -- but typically I will
        write more than one.</p>

        <p>Saturday I met with the client. We discussed the project as a whole -- big picture design
         elements. The project is to build a system where visually impaired and blind people
         can shoot basketball. We are going to be working with a group of high school students
         at North Oldham High School -- essentially a partnership between us and NOHS. We will
         be responsible for software development.</p>

         <p>There are two parts to the system -- hardware and software. Like I said, we are mainly focusing
         on the software, but we will need to work with microcontrollers and sensors. Byron has
         experience with embedded systems so he's agreed to take lead on this. Currently he is
         conducting research on what hardware we should buy. I should mention that our client has
         a budget to purchase the necessary hardware. The second part of the system is mobile development.
         We are going to develop both iOS and Android applications that interact with the embedded
         systems.</p>

         <p>The team (minus Thomas -- feel better man) met Sunday August 28th. I informed them on the big
         picture design. Everyone seems to be ambitious about the project :). To see the rough outline
         we discussed, download <a href="/website/design_doc.docx">this</a> file.
         We will constantly be updating this document<p>

         <p>Next we need to begin designing the AGILE process -- epics, sprints, and stories. We also need
         to allocate stories to team member. Bryon is taking the lead on the embedded systems, Thomas is
         taking the lead on Android development, and I'm going to take the lead on iOS development.
         Matt and Jared will join in on whatever we deem necessary. Plus we'll all sort of bounce
         around and help each other out.</p>

       <p>I spent some time documenting the specifications. You can find all documents on the gitHub
         repo (linked on home page) in <i>/specifications/*</i>. We will constantly update these docs as we discover better
         methods of implementing the system.</p>

       <p>I also spent some time beginning to design the AGILE epic's. Well, the embedded systems one at least.
         That can be found in <i>/backlog/*</i>.<p>
