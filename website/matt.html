           Our first group meeting was Sunday, August 28. We discussed the general concept for our project, began to brainstorm challenges and solutions,
           and established some preliminary project roles. In this first week as a group, we began to host our team webpage on my Multilab account, before
           realizing that Github would make a more accessible platform for the webpage and merge seamlessly with the repository already hosted on the site.
           
           I re-flashed the SD card on my RaspberryPi 2 so that the team can compare it to other options for processing data from our hardware and passing
           it to our applications. We recognize that other hardware, such as an Arduino, may be more suited to the task of communicating with hardware, but
           the Pi may be a useful tool for the processing of data and will be easier for us to work with. We may incorporate both options into different,
           but cooperating roles.
