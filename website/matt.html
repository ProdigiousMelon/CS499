           <p>Our first group meeting was Sunday, August 28. We discussed the general concept for our project, began to brainstorm challenges and solutions,
           and established some preliminary project roles. In this first week as a group, we began to host our team webpage on my Multilab account, before
           realizing that Github would make a more accessible platform for the webpage and merge seamlessly with the repository already hosted on the site.</p>
           
           <p>I re-flashed the SD card on my RaspberryPi 2 so that the team can compare it to other options for processing data from our hardware and passing
           it to our applications. We recognize that other hardware, such as an Arduino, may be more suited to the task of communicating with hardware, but
           the Pi may be a useful tool for the processing of data and will be easier for us to work with. We may incorporate both options into different,
           but cooperating roles.<p>

	  <p>We are working on the project plan assignment due monday. This week I have been working on the risk list with Jared, as well as splitting up the use cases with Byron.
	  I will be helping Thomas with Android development once we reach that phase, so I am beginning to look into tutorials online to get myself up to speed.</p>

	  <p>We have been working on the architecture assignment this week. We hope to turn it in by next Wednesday so that Dr. Hayes can provide feedback, so we plan to meet Sunday to discuss it.
	  I have spent time looking through Android development tutorials to prepare for development as we finish up on documentation assignments.</p>
