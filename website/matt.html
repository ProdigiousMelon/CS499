           <p>Our first group meeting was Sunday, August 28. We discussed the general concept for our project, began to brainstorm challenges and solutions,
           and established some preliminary project roles. In this first week as a group, we began to host our team webpage on my Multilab account, before
           realizing that Github would make a more accessible platform for the webpage and merge seamlessly with the repository already hosted on the site.</p>
           
           <p>I re-flashed the SD card on my RaspberryPi 2 so that the team can compare it to other options for processing data from our hardware and passing
           it to our applications. We recognize that other hardware, such as an Arduino, may be more suited to the task of communicating with hardware, but
           the Pi may be a useful tool for the processing of data and will be easier for us to work with. We may incorporate both options into different,
           but cooperating roles.<p>

	  <p>We are working on the project plan assignment due monday. This week I have been working on the risk list with Jared, as well as splitting up the use cases with Byron.
	  I will be helping Thomas with Android development once we reach that phase, so I am beginning to look into tutorials online to get myself up to speed.</p>

	  <p>We have been working on the architecture assignment this week. We hope to turn it in by next Wednesday so that Dr. Hayes can provide feedback, so we plan to meet Sunday to discuss it.
	  I have spent time looking through Android development tutorials to prepare for development as we finish up on documentation assignments.</p>

	  <p>This week I worked on the class diagrams for the architecture assignment to begin laying out the structure of our project. The class diagram will help to direct our efforts as we move full force into development by offering a clear picture of the associations between classes.
          I have also continued working on getting up to speed with android development to prepare for the coming weeks.</p>

	  <p>Kendall has provided me with a link to a tutorial to implement Google Firebase authentication for Android. I am going to work on a basic UI for the Android app first so that we have a platform to work from in the meantime.
          I am using android studio as my IDE. It provides useful real-time suggestions and warnings, debugging, and android device emulation, among other things.</p>

	  <p>Exams and other assignments have slowed down work on authentication a bit. I have followed the tutorials that Kendall provided, but the sign-in button is currently unresponsive. I will work on debugging and reviewing my code when my schedule clears up a bit more.</p>

	  <p>I have asked Thomas to take a look at Firebase authentication. I think the issue may be in our google-services.json file which contains configuration data from our google services and firebase account. This was provided by Kendall because we are using his account. It may be easiest, while we are prototyping, to simply register another account and generate our own configuration file for Android. This will separate our iOS and Android databases, which is less than ideal, but will make it easier for us to move forward with prototyping in the short term.</p>

	  <p>Thomas hasn't been able to identify the issue with my attempt at Firebase authentication. However, he has been able to get a separate test app working with his own account. He hasn't been able to apply his findings to our project, but he has provided me with the tutorial that he used. I will try to generate my own working authentication test app, then move our existing code into that.</p>

	  <p>I have successfully implemented firebase authentication for Android, and moved our existing code into the working project. For the time being, iOS and Android will be using separate Firebase accounts, which means that we will be operating with two separate databases. We believe that at this time, the most important thing is to get a working prototype. I have committed this project to Git so that Thomas can add some of the functional components that he has been working on, such as the games and statistics generation.</p>
