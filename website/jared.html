	<p>I will regularly post log entries in order to keep track of my contribution to our teamâ€™s Senior Design Project.</p>
	<p> Our team first met on Sunday, August 28 from 5 - 7 pm. The goal of the meeting was to discuss the overview of our project and address any questions team members had up front. We also identified strengths of our team members and what area each of us were comfortable working in as well as what areas we lacked knowledge but were eager to learn. We then took this information to select leaders for various aspects of the project, such as Android development, iOS development, and embedded systems. Initial tasks were also assigned.</p>
	<p>The team met again on Monday, September 6 for roughly one hour. The goal of the meeting was to finalize a list of hardware we needed for the project, as it is being purchased by the client and there is a process for approval. I am working with Kendall and possible some others on preparing our use cases and requirements document for Friday.</p>
