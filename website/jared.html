	<p>I will regularly post log entries in order to keep track of my contribution to our team’s Senior Design Project.</p>
	<p> Our team first met on Sunday, August 28 from 5 - 7 pm. The goal of the meeting was to discuss the overview of our project and address any questions team members had up front. We also identified strengths of our team members and what area each of us were comfortable working in as well as what areas we lacked knowledge but were eager to learn. We then took this information to select leaders for various aspects of the project, such as Android development, iOS development, and embedded systems. Initial tasks were also assigned.</p>
	<p>The team met again on Monday, September 6 for roughly one hour. The goal of the meeting was to finalize a list of hardware we needed for the project, as it is being purchased by the client and there is a process for approval. I am working with Kendall and possible some others on preparing our use cases and requirements document for Friday.</p>

                <p>I drafted two use cases in preparation for Friday’s assignment. I coordinated with Thomas for feedback. He suggested I take the lead on our team’s documentation. As lead, if an assignment is delegated among team members, I will gather each individual contribution and create one, cohesive document for submission.</p>

        <p>We are planning to meet again soon. From there, we will further develop use cases and begin preparing our Project Plan document.</p>

		<p>The team met again on Sunday, September 11 for roughly one hour. The goal of the meeting was to assign each team member specific tasks for the Project Plan document that is due next Monday. I have assumed a project manager-type role. I am responsible for keeping the team organized, submitting assignments, and meeting deadlines. I delegated sections of the Project Plan and Requirements Documents to each team member. Each section is to be complete by Sunday so that I can compile each part into a cohesive document. It will then be reviewed at our weekly meeting. I will then make any last edits before submitting.</p>

		<p>After the meeting adjourned, I updated our Google Docs folder with everyone’s action items and notified the group for sign off and approval. Last night, I worked on my portion of the Requirements Document: the introduction. I am also responsible for the Title Page, Table of Contents, and Conclusion; however, I will complete these at the end after the rest of the document has been completed. I am also working on developing a risk list as well as use cases when I receive complete user stories.</p>

	<p>I spent the past week doing my share of the Project Plan assignment. I was responsible for the Introduction, Risk List, Schedule and Resource Allocation, and Conclusion sections. I also was the document editor and formatted the document title page, Table of Contents and Table of Figures.</p>
	<p>The team met again last night again for roughly one hour. We reviewed our current status before moving our attention to the Project Plan. All sections were supposed to be complete before the meeting so I had ample time to edit and format the document for submission. There were several sections that were still in progress or left blank. We delegated these sections amongst the members of the team. I also created a checklist of what was still to be completed and who it was to be completed by. That way, I could cross each task off the list when I received word it was complete to ensure all requirements were met for the assignment.<p>
	<p>I put the finishing touches on the document this morning before submitting it to the CSPortal. I just updated our team site with the Project Plan document. It can be viewed <a href="documentation.html">here</a>.<p>
	<p>My goal for this week is to begin preparation for the Architecture Assignment that was assigned today. I would like to finish the assignment in advance so we are not left making any last minute changes or edits to the documents hours before it is due. I will also be lending a helping hand to anyone else on the team who needs assistance, especially Byron when the hardware arrives by mail. The embedded system is the groundwork for the project. It is also the most involved. I will be sure to help him with this to be sure we can meet our deadlines.<p>
