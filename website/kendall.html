      <h3>Log 1</h3>
      <p>
          Welcome to my log feed. I will post a weekly log entry at a minimum -- but typically I will
          write more than one. </br></br>
          Saturday I met with the client. We discussed the project as a whole -- big picture design
          elements. The project is to build a system where visually impaired and blind people
          can shoot basketball. We are going to be working with a group of high school students
          at North Oldham High School -- essentially a partnership between us and NOHS. We will
          be responsible for software development. </br></br>

          There are two parts to the system -- hardware and software. Like I said, we are mainly focusing
          on the software, but we will need to work with microcontrollers and sensors. Byron has
          experience with embedded systems so he's agreed to take lead on this. Currently he is
          conducting research on what hardware we should buy. I should mention that our client has
          a budget to purchase the necessary hardware. The second part of the system is mobile development.
          We are going to develop both iOS and Android applications that interact with the embedded
          systems. </br></br>

          The team (minus Thomas -- feel better man) met Sunday August 28th. I informed them on the big
          picture design. Everyone seems to be ambitious about the project :). To see the rough outline
          we discussed, download <a href="/website/design_doc.docx" download>this</a> file.
          We will constantly be updating this document</br></br>

          Next we need to begin designing the AGILE process -- epics, sprints, and stories. We also need
          to allocate stories to team member. Bryon is taking the lead on the embedded systems, Thomas is
          taking the lead on Android development, and I'm going to take the lead on iOS development.
          Matt and Jared will join in on whatever we deem necessary. Plus we'll all sort of bounce
          around and help each other out. </br></br>
