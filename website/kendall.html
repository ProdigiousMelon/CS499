          Monday, August 29th 2016<br></p>

          <p>Welcome to my log feed. I will post a weekly log entry at a minimum -- but typically I will
          write more than one.</p>

          <p>Saturday I met with the client. We discussed the project as a whole -- big picture design
           elements. The project is to build a system where visually impaired and blind people
           can shoot basketball. We are going to be working with a group of high school students
           at North Oldham High School -- essentially a partnership between us and NOHS. We will
           be responsible for software development.</p>

           <p>There are two parts to the system -- hardware and software. Like I said, we are mainly focusing
           on the software, but we will need to work with microcontrollers and sensors. Byron has
           experience with embedded systems so he's agreed to take lead on this. Currently he is
           conducting research on what hardware we should buy. I should mention that our client has
           a budget to purchase the necessary hardware. The second part of the system is mobile development.
           We are going to develop both iOS and Android applications that interact with the embedded
           systems.</p>

           <p>The team (minus Thomas -- feel better man) met Sunday August 28th. I informed them on the big
           picture design. Everyone seems to be ambitious about the project :). To see the rough outline
           we discussed, download <a href="/website/design_doc.docx">this</a> file.
           We will constantly be updating this document<p>

           <p>Next we need to begin designing the AGILE process -- epics, sprints, and stories. We also need
           to allocate stories to team member. Bryon is taking the lead on the embedded systems, Thomas is
           taking the lead on Android development, and I'm going to take the lead on iOS development.
           Matt and Jared will join in on whatever we deem necessary. Plus we'll all sort of bounce
           around and help each other out.</p>

       <p>I spent some time documenting the specifications. You can find all documents on the gitHub
         repo (linked on home page) in <i>/specifications/*</i>. We will constantly update these docs as we discover better
         methods of implementing the system.</p>

       <p>I also spent some time beginning to design the AGILE epic's. Well, the embedded systems one at least.
         That can be found in <i>/backlog/*</i>.<p>

         <p>Byron, Jared, and I met Monday evening to discuss what needs to be done this week. We are planning on doing a weekly meeting,
         just like a weekly sprint meeting. This weeks was really more of a sprint planning meeting.</p>

         <p>This week we are setting a deadline to get hardware ordered (or at least sent to Mr. Williams) by this Friday.
         Byron has proposed a prototype system. The system consists of 4 microcontrollers that act as anchors, and a RSSI frequency emitter.
         Essentially the user will have a sensor that emits a pulse, the anchors pick up the signal, they all communicate with a Raspberry Pi, and the
         Raspberry Pi computes the coordinates. I like the idea because it's simple. It may or may not be used as the end product, but it is worth trying.
         You know, start simple and build one step at a time.</p>

         <p>My only concern is that is won't have good enough precision. Byron is going to email Dr. Lump and get his take on it.</p>

         <p>The frequency emitter can be found <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10524">here</a></p>

         <p>All in total, this order shouldn't cost more than $40-$50.</p>

         <p>We already have a Raspberry Pi. We will need to purchase 4 Arduino microcontrollers, the frequency emitter,
         maybe a breadboard, and some other small things such as wires and capacitors -- Byron is building the full list.</p>

         <p>As for the rest of the team... Thomas did a really good job designing the website this past week. We have a use cases document due
         this Friday that we are all going to work on together. We also have Resume's due Tomorrow (Wed. Sept. 7th). Matt and Thomas have
         agreed to take over the Android development.</p>

          Monday Sept. 12th 2016<br></p>

          <p>We had our weekly sprint meeting Sunday night. Matt can’t make the team meetings unfortunately. This Sunday we talked about the upcoming document due next Monday (Sept. 19th). We also talked about what it’s going to take to get that completed, and we talked about the positioning system hardware. Lastly, we discussed what the mobile application feature set will be.
            </p>
          <p>The document due next Monday is the Project Plan, and there is a ton to it. We are pretty much planning out the entire project. Although, we have to understand that nothing in this document will be concrete — we will have to adapt to situations as we go. Jared, our documentation guy, is helping delegate who needs to do what. Jared and Matt are going to cover things like introduction, and conclusion. The rest of the document is mainly functional requirements, so Byron, Thomas, and I will be working on that. The main thing here is creating user stories. So I’m going to work on that tonight and hopefully get them all completed. A user story consists of a title, a description, a priority, and a point ranking. Typically, the way I like to do user stories, is to not have any stories over 4 points. However, since I have no experience in iOS development it is difficult for me to estimate how long it will take to accomplish something. Therefore, I’m going to estimate some stories over 4 points. The number one priority will be to do a crash-course iOS tutorial. We hope to have everyone complete their parts by Sunday so that we can clean it all up at our weekly sprint meeting.
            </p>
          <p>We believe we have all the hardware figured out for the positioning system. I’m going to copy and paste the description I sent to Mr. Williams:
            </p>
          <p>There are 5 Arduino microcontrollers (Arduino Uno). Each microcontroller has a radio module. The radio module can send and receive radio signals with 300 different channels (or something like that). There will be 4 microcontrollers set up around the court perimeter, and these are the "anchors" (as an end product we will want to triangulate, but for a prototype we want to keep it simple -- a square is much easier to compute position). The user has the 5th microcontroller. The users radio module emits a pulse, and the anchors receive the pulse. All the microcontrollers have clocks, so depending on the time it takes to receive the signal we can compute a distance perpendicular to each anchor (radio signals travel at the speed of light d = r*t). Subsequently the 4 anchors will communicate with a raspberry Pi (a small UNIX microcontroller -- we already have some of these), and the raspberry pi will compute position. The raspberry pi will serve as the "central hub" for all embedded systems.
            </p>
          <p>There are also other various parts -- batteries, power supplies, and voltage droppers that will be needed.
            </p>
          <p>These are all the features we are thinking about for the mobile application.
            </p>

          <ul>
            <li>User account authentication</li>
            <li>Cloud based database</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Statistics</li>
                <li>User information</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Games</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Horse</li>
                <li>First to n points</li>
                <li>How many shots can be made in n time</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p>One thing that we haven’t figured out is how to determine who’s shot when in given there is more than 1 person playing. Since there is so much to this project, we are going to plan on having a prototype for the end result. That prototype will consist of a positioning system, a backboard speaker (for direction), and a system to tell the user where the shot landed. All of the above will be for a single user.
            </p>
          <p>Oh, we also need to have Mr. Williams sign an intellectual property agreement. I couldn’t find it on the web page, so I emailed Dr. Hayes. She’s in China so it may be a couple of days until she responds to me.
            </p>

        Sunday Sept. 25th 2016<br></p>

            <p>The Project Plan document turned out solid, and we got a satisfying grade. I put in quite a bit of work for that -- roughly 3000 words. We have another assignment due soon, and we plan on having that completed by Tuesday. Today the team met and discussed this assignment. I had to miss the meeting since I was out of town. They have delegated a couple of sections to me, and I will have them completed by Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Today I emailed the client. I attached the Project Plan so that he can review. The main thing I highlighted was what we plan on developing, and what we hope his high school students can work on. This is one thing Dr. Hayes said we should really highlight -- that we are in a partnership with North OIdham High School (NOHS). Mr. Williams claimed this is the first partnership that NOHS has had with UKY, so I want to make sure we give a good first impression.</p>

            <p>We have decided to develop:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mobile applications -- both iOS and Android</li>
              <li>Location/positioning system</li>
              <li>Distance system</li>
              <li>Whether or not a shot was made</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>We are asking the NOHS students to develop:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A system to throw the ball back to the user</li>
              <li>A system to sense where the users shot landed (after taking a shot)</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>I have also requested a purchase order for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The first three months are free, so this will need to be purchased at a later date. I wanted to go ahead and inform the client this was our route of choice.</p>
            <p>Also, Thomas designed the BIOS (biography's) page. I'm going to go ahead and write mine. This week there are several UKY Career Services events, so it's a good opportunity to focus on both my contributions to this project and my professional resume.</p>
            <p>This week I will be kept fairly busy between other classes and Career Services events. I hope to begin iOS development this week. My first goal will be to establish communication between the iOS device and the GCP. I'm unsure of the recommended protocol for iOS, so I have quite a bit of research to do.</p>

            <p>After doing some research, we have decided to utilize the Firebase service.
                Firebase is a service that integrates with Google Cloud Platform and
                handles all backend services. This will make things WAY simpler. Simpler is
                good for several reasons: quicker development (we are busy students) and easier
                for the high school students to follow.</p>

          <p>After the little bit of iOS dev I did over the weekend, I'm excited to get started.
              Midterm weeks are coming up these next two weeks, so development might slow down a little.
              After midterms are finished, I should have time to crank out quite a bit of development.</p>

          <p>
            It's been a couple of weeks since my last log -- midterm weeks have kept me busy. Today I spent about 5 hours
            working on iOS dev. I plan on spending a little more time today and about the same amount of time tomorrow.
            By tomorrow evening I would like to have Google authentication worked out, and maybe start on a primitive
            statistics/data page. Right now I have a successful authentication build, but there is one more bug
            to work out. The coding assignment is due in 3 weeks, which means I would like to have nearly all of the code written by then.
            There is a lot of work to do until then.
          </p>

          <p>
            Parts finally came in! Right now we have 5 Arduino Uno's and all the parts for each board. I gave 3 boards to
            Byron so that he can begin working on the positioning system. The other 2 boards are for the iOS and Android dev.
            We are waiting on another shipment of parts. After the next shipment, we should have all the hardware needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have a team meeting tomorrow. After the meeting I'm hoping we have a good gameplan on the development
            over the next two or three weeks.

          <p>
            First off, it's been two weeks since my last log. Apologies. That doesn't mean I haven't been iOS coding, but I just haven't had the time to log about it. These past two weeks I've put on two seminars for the Computer Science department. I've had four different lab coding assignments. I've had a major coding project in an upper level course. I've had normal work hours. To tie it all together, I was sick last weekend. But, like I said, I have done some iOS coding so let's talk about that.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've designed the pages and navigation's between them. I believe I put a video in the BasketballVision Slack channel. Oh yeah, our collective team (between NOHS and UKY) have opened a Slack channel so that we can all communicate through it. Anyways, there is a login page which directs to the home page. The home page has buttons to a statistics page and a games page. The games page has a list of games. Google authentication is complete, although there is a lingering bug I can't seem to figure out. The user authenticates, but when I use a library function to get the current users data, it returns nil -- leaving me to believe that it is authenticating, but not saving the data. However, for the short term I know a work around. I learned how to pass data between views (which is my solution to the bug). The biggest milestone I have made is learning how to query the database. I don't have it totally figured out (because Firebase has little to no documentation) but I have a primitive understanding. I'm able to retrieve and save data, which is basically all we need for a prototype.          </p>
          <p>
            The idea with the database is that it will store user information and statistics. So the embedded system will send a bluetooth packet to the iOS device, the iOS device will then convey that information to the database. Also, the database could be used for games.          </p>

          <p>
            This weekend I'm going to try and finish nearly all of the coding. November 14th there is a major coding assignment due. Which means by then I need to have nearly all of the code written. The coding I have left to do is...
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Clean user interface</li>
            <li>Complete all the games pages -- include buttons and text instructions</li>
            <li>Determine how the app can receive bluetooth packets -- then receive and send packets to the database</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Ok I have most of the coding done for the prototype. I don’t have any design element developed — I always save UI design as the last step. I’ve just been working on backend functionality. I’ve recorded a video showing what I’ve done so far, and you should be able to download it here. Our coding assignment is due tomorrow, and I have all the code written for that. I’ve written all the test cases, integration testing, and metrics for the iOS portions of the coding assignment. Our presentation is Friday, so between now and then I’m going to try and clean the UI up a little bit, although that’s not too pressing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some major breakthroughs I’ve made… I have a really good grasp on how the database library calls work and how to manipulate data in the database. I’ve also implemented the text to voice feature. So now when the user wants to know the number of points they’ve scored over their current game session, they can click a button and it will say “You have scored 12 points in the current game session.” Since the system isn’t functioning as a whole, I’ve developed what I call “simulation” buttons. They simulate whether a shot was made, and if it was a 2 or 3 pointer. These buttons are for testing purposes. I really recommend watching the video because it explains all of this well. Now that I’ve made these breakthroughs, development should be smoother from here out. I was completely inexperienced with iOS development. I still feel like a rookie, but I’m getting better.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve always spoken with Cole from the NOHS team. He’s developed an Arduino program for detecting the location the basketball lands on the backboard. The code looked good — he even included a bubble sort algorithm. He asked us for some pointers, so we gave him a few. I just sent an email to Mr. Williams, updating him on where we are and where we are going.

            We have a team meeting in about an hour. We are going to complete the coding assignment, and then start planning for the presentation on Friday. Jared and I spoke at the first presentation, so the other 3 group member should definitely speak at this presentation. Although I might have to go up there too since I’m the only one in charge of iOS development. We’ll figure this out today.
