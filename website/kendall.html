          Log 1<br>
          Monday, August 29th 2016<br></p>

          <p>Welcome to my log feed. I will post a weekly log entry at a minimum -- but typically I will
          write more than one.</p>

          <p>Saturday I met with the client. We discussed the project as a whole -- big picture design
           elements. The project is to build a system where visually impaired and blind people
           can shoot basketball. We are going to be working with a group of high school students
           at North Oldham High School -- essentially a partnership between us and NOHS. We will
           be responsible for software development.</p>

           <p>There are two parts to the system -- hardware and software. Like I said, we are mainly focusing
           on the software, but we will need to work with microcontrollers and sensors. Byron has
           experience with embedded systems so he's agreed to take lead on this. Currently he is
           conducting research on what hardware we should buy. I should mention that our client has
           a budget to purchase the necessary hardware. The second part of the system is mobile development.
           We are going to develop both iOS and Android applications that interact with the embedded
           systems.</p>

           <p>The team (minus Thomas -- feel better man) met Sunday August 28th. I informed them on the big
           picture design. Everyone seems to be ambitious about the project :). To see the rough outline
           we discussed, download <a href="/website/design_doc.docx">this</a> file.
           We will constantly be updating this document<p>

           <p>Next we need to begin designing the AGILE process -- epics, sprints, and stories. We also need
           to allocate stories to team member. Bryon is taking the lead on the embedded systems, Thomas is
           taking the lead on Android development, and I'm going to take the lead on iOS development.
           Matt and Jared will join in on whatever we deem necessary. Plus we'll all sort of bounce
           around and help each other out.</p>

       <p>I spent some time documenting the specifications. You can find all documents on the gitHub
         repo (linked on home page) in <i>/specifications/*</i>. We will constantly update these docs as we discover better
         methods of implementing the system.</p>

       <p>I also spent some time beginning to design the AGILE epic's. Well, the embedded systems one at least.
         That can be found in <i>/backlog/*</i>.<p>

         Tuesday Sept. 7th 2016<br></p>

         <p>Byron, Jared, and I met Monday evening to discuss what needs to be done this week. We are planning on doing a weekly meeting,
         just like a weekly sprint meeting. This weeks was really more of a sprint planning meeting.</p>

         <p>This week we are setting a deadline to get hardware ordered (or at least sent to Mr. Williams) by this Friday.
         Byron has proposed a prototype system. The system consists of 4 microcontrollers that act as anchors, and a RSSI frequency emitter.
         Essentially the user will have a sensor that emits a pulse, the anchors pick up the signal, they all communicate with a Raspberry Pi, and the
         Raspberry Pi computes the coordinates. I like the idea because it's simple. It may or may not be used as the end product, but it is worth trying.
         You know, start simple and build one step at a time.</p>

         <p>My only concern is that is won't have good enough precision. Byron is going to email Dr. Lump and get his take on it.</p>

         <p>The frequency emitter can be found <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10524">here</a></p>

         <p>All in total, this order shouldn't cost more than $40-$50.</p>

         <p>We already have a Raspberry Pi. We will need to purchase 4 Arduino microcontrollers, the frequency emitter,
         maybe a breadboard, and some other small things such as wires and capacitors -- Byron is building the full list.</p>

         <p>As for the rest of the team... Thomas did a really good job designing the website this past week. We have a use cases document due
         this Friday that we are all going to work on together. We also have Resume's due Tomorrow (Wed. Sept. 7th). Matt and Thomas have
         agreed to take over the Android development.</p>
