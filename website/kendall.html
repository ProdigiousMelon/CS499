          Log 1<br>
          Monday, August 29th 2016<br></p>

          <p>Welcome to my log feed. I will post a weekly log entry at a minimum -- but typically I will
          write more than one.</p>

          <p>Saturday I met with the client. We discussed the project as a whole -- big picture design
           elements. The project is to build a system where visually impaired and blind people
           can shoot basketball. We are going to be working with a group of high school students
           at North Oldham High School -- essentially a partnership between us and NOHS. We will
           be responsible for software development.</p>

           <p>There are two parts to the system -- hardware and software. Like I said, we are mainly focusing
           on the software, but we will need to work with microcontrollers and sensors. Byron has
           experience with embedded systems so he's agreed to take lead on this. Currently he is
           conducting research on what hardware we should buy. I should mention that our client has
           a budget to purchase the necessary hardware. The second part of the system is mobile development.
           We are going to develop both iOS and Android applications that interact with the embedded
           systems.</p>

           <p>The team (minus Thomas -- feel better man) met Sunday August 28th. I informed them on the big
           picture design. Everyone seems to be ambitious about the project :). To see the rough outline
           we discussed, download <a href="/website/design_doc.docx">this</a> file.
           We will constantly be updating this document<p>

           <p>Next we need to begin designing the AGILE process -- epics, sprints, and stories. We also need
           to allocate stories to team member. Bryon is taking the lead on the embedded systems, Thomas is
           taking the lead on Android development, and I'm going to take the lead on iOS development.
           Matt and Jared will join in on whatever we deem necessary. Plus we'll all sort of bounce
           around and help each other out.</p>

       <p>I spent some time documenting the specifications. You can find all documents on the gitHub
         repo (linked on home page) in <i>/specifications/*</i>. We will constantly update these docs as we discover better
         methods of implementing the system.</p>

       <p>I also spent some time beginning to design the AGILE epic's. Well, the embedded systems one at least.
         That can be found in <i>/backlog/*</i>.<p>

         <p>Byron, Jared, and I met Monday evening to discuss what needs to be done this week. We are planning on doing a weekly meeting,
         just like a weekly sprint meeting. This weeks was really more of a sprint planning meeting.</p>

         <p>This week we are setting a deadline to get hardware ordered (or at least sent to Mr. Williams) by this Friday.
         Byron has proposed a prototype system. The system consists of 4 microcontrollers that act as anchors, and a RSSI frequency emitter.
         Essentially the user will have a sensor that emits a pulse, the anchors pick up the signal, they all communicate with a Raspberry Pi, and the
         Raspberry Pi computes the coordinates. I like the idea because it's simple. It may or may not be used as the end product, but it is worth trying.
         You know, start simple and build one step at a time.</p>

         <p>My only concern is that is won't have good enough precision. Byron is going to email Dr. Lump and get his take on it.</p>

         <p>The frequency emitter can be found <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10524">here</a></p>

         <p>All in total, this order shouldn't cost more than $40-$50.</p>

         <p>We already have a Raspberry Pi. We will need to purchase 4 Arduino microcontrollers, the frequency emitter,
         maybe a breadboard, and some other small things such as wires and capacitors -- Byron is building the full list.</p>

         <p>As for the rest of the team... Thomas did a really good job designing the website this past week. We have a use cases document due
         this Friday that we are all going to work on together. We also have Resume's due Tomorrow (Wed. Sept. 7th). Matt and Thomas have
         agreed to take over the Android development.</p>

          Monday Sept. 12th 2016<br></p>

          <p>We had our weekly sprint meeting Sunday night. Matt can’t make the team meetings unfortunately. This Sunday we talked about the upcoming document due next Monday (Sept. 19th). We also talked about what it’s going to take to get that completed, and we talked about the positioning system hardware. Lastly, we discussed what the mobile application feature set will be.
            </p>
          <p>The document due next Monday is the Project Plan, and there is a ton to it. We are pretty much planning out the entire project. Although, we have to understand that nothing in this document will be concrete — we will have to adapt to situations as we go. Jared, our documentation guy, is helping delegate who needs to do what. Jared and Matt are going to cover things like introduction, and conclusion. The rest of the document is mainly functional requirements, so Byron, Thomas, and I will be working on that. The main thing here is creating user stories. So I’m going to work on that tonight and hopefully get them all completed. A user story consists of a title, a description, a priority, and a point ranking. Typically, the way I like to do user stories, is to not have any stories over 4 points. However, since I have no experience in iOS development it is difficult for me to estimate how long it will take to accomplish something. Therefore, I’m going to estimate some stories over 4 points. The number one priority will be to do a crash-course iOS tutorial. We hope to have everyone complete their parts by Sunday so that we can clean it all up at our weekly sprint meeting.
            </p>
          <p>We believe we have all the hardware figured out for the positioning system. I’m going to copy and paste the description I sent to Mr. Williams:
            </p>
          <p>There are 5 Arduino microcontrollers (Arduino Uno). Each microcontroller has a radio module. The radio module can send and receive radio signals with 300 different channels (or something like that). There will be 4 microcontrollers set up around the court perimeter, and these are the "anchors" (as an end product we will want to triangulate, but for a prototype we want to keep it simple -- a square is much easier to compute position). The user has the 5th microcontroller. The users radio module emits a pulse, and the anchors receive the pulse. All the microcontrollers have clocks, so depending on the time it takes to receive the signal we can compute a distance perpendicular to each anchor (radio signals travel at the speed of light d = r*t). Subsequently the 4 anchors will communicate with a raspberry Pi (a small UNIX microcontroller -- we already have some of these), and the raspberry pi will compute position. The raspberry pi will serve as the "central hub" for all embedded systems.
            </p>
          <p>There are also other various parts -- batteries, power supplies, and voltage droppers that will be needed.
            </p>
          <p>These are all the features we are thinking about for the mobile application.
            </p>

          <ul>
            <li>User account authentication</li>
            <li>Cloud based database</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Statistics</li>
                <li>User information</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Games</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Horse</li>
                <li>First to n points</li>
                <li>How many shots can be made in n time</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p>One thing that we haven’t figured out is how to determine who’s shot when in given there is more than 1 person playing. Since there is so much to this project, we are going to plan on having a prototype for the end result. That prototype will consist of a positioning system, a backboard speaker (for direction), and a system to tell the user where the shot landed. All of the above will be for a single user.
            </p>
          <p>Oh, we also need to have Mr. Williams sign an intellectual property agreement. I couldn’t find it on the web page, so I emailed Dr. Hayes. She’s in China so it may be a couple of days until she responds to me.
            </p>
