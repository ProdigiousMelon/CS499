            This is a space where I will post fairly update-to-date information about what I am currently
            doing in order to contribute to the success of our project for CS499.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was asked by Kendall to improve/work on our project site. So for my first task I created a site
            template and made it visually appealing as well as useful (posting all necessary and contributing info).
            I wrote the corresponding HTML and CSS in order to create a dynamic and appealing project site.
