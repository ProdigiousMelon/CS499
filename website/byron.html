            Wednesday, August 31st 2016<br></p>

            <p>We could probably get away with just two cameras if we were to go this route but it really all depends on what we decide for the other parts of our system. Synergy is key to reduce cost and equipment. </p>
          <p>Speaking with Dr. Lump I found immediately that there are many options that we can explore to meet the design specifications. </p>
            <p>There are three main areas of concern that need to be addressed in the design of our system. First, is the tracking of the player, next is the tracking of the movement of the ball, and lastly is signal processing unit. </p>
            <p>For the tracking of the player there were a myriad of solutions. What immediately jumped to mind was indoor GPS. A quick search at Spark Fun or ADA Fruit turned up some results of packages ranging from $10 to over $100 that would be able to report positioning. The challenge with indoor GPS is that it’s tough to get heading and direction. Still this may be a cheap way of getting the XYZ coordinates of the players. </p>
            <p> Another option is, Computer Vision motion tracking. Computer Vision analyzes a series of images and report back motion and positioning information. There is an interesting article about Computer Vision motion tracking: </p> </br>
            http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/
            </br>
            <p>For the tracking of the ball, Computer Vision might be the best option, if we are trying to use a standard basketball. To make the system more accessible, it would be best to use as many standard parts as possible. Because of the nature of the game and the rapid movement of the ball, affixing a device to the ball may prove to be cumbersome. With Computer Vision, and a brightly colored ball, we would be able to track its movement in real time. This may be subject to change as we settle on the other parts of the system. </p>
            <p>Lastly is the signal processing unit or module that will be used to not only collect the data from the independent tracking devices, but also broadcast the information in such a way to be utilized by AndroidOS and iOS applications on each player’s phone. A nine axis sensor was suggested to communicate between a Computer/Arduino/Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC)/Raspberry Pi/ Intel atom). If we want to do app development for this system, my recommendation is either the Raspberry pi or an Arduino. This is because of the pre-existing support. </p>
            <p>More information coming this weekend, where hopefully we can solidify the specifications for the system. </p>

      			<p>in the interim since the last blog entry, I have met with Dr.Lump two more times. Once on Monday, September 5th, and again the following Wednesday, September 7th. Dr. Lump's assistance was invaluable, once the project scope solidified. I also plan on meeting him tomorrow Monday Sept 12th</p>

      			<p>As a team we have decided to pursue position tracking through an RSSI or Receive Signal Strength Indicator. The RFM transceiver chosen was Spark Fun RFM69 Breakout (915MHz). This particular transceiver runs in the unlicensed ISM, or Industry, Science, and Medical band. The position tracking system had to meet several constraints to be applicable in our project. First, was accuracy. This transceiver is capable of broadcasting up to 50 meters through walls, also with a max 300kbps bit rate, we can update signal strength frequently. Second, it had to be able to report back to PC or microcontroller. For this the Arduino UNO was chosen to process the RF signal via serial connection. The Arduino can then in turn broadcast that data via serial COM port where we can then handle the data</p>

      			<p>For the Arduino and the transceiver to communicate with one another, a logic level converter is needed. The Arduino Uno operates at 5V and it needs to be stepped down to the operating range of the transceiver</p>

      			<p>In order to change this signal strength information into position information, we will have 4 beacons broadcasting on each side of the court. The player will also be carrying a transceiver. By taking a mean average of the relative signal strength of the player to the four beacons, a system of position can be established. </p>


      			<p>each transceiver unit contains the following: A radio module, an Arduino Uno, a rechargeable Lithium polymer battery, Logic Level converter. Additional equipment such as breadboards and wires are included on the spread sheet.</p>

      			<p>Next design concern is goal interaction.</p>

      			<p>Today was our weekly sprint meeting. The objective was to solidify the Requirements specifications. Also to clear up operational specifications.</p>
      			<p>I created half of the use cases. In particular, the follow five:</br></br>
      				<ul>
      					<li>User logs in</li>
      					<li>User shoots ball</li>
      					<li>User requests position</li>

      					<li>User makes changes to settings</li>
      				</ul>
      			</p></br>
      			<p>I was also in charge of creating the system block diagram. There are several moving parts for our system, so it was important to show not only how the pieces interact but also what is contained on each node. Flowcharts for the functionality were constructed in draw.io, all other charts designed in PowerPoint</p>

    	 <p>We then took some time to discuss a plan of action for the next sprint. Decided that it was important to focus on wiring and addressing one node first.</p>

        	<p>Found a guide for proper Antenna length. An antenna should be 1/4th of the wavelength of that is being sampled(Nyquist). For our RFM module at 915MHz that is roughly 78mm</p>

        	<p>No sprint meeting this week. Spent time wiring node#2 in the embedded lab in FPAT. Successfully soldered headers and antenna on the RFM Breakout chip, but ran out of headers</p>
        	<p>For the record, the RFM has 8 pins that require soldered headers and the logic stepper requires 12. Going "borrow" some from the office and continue later</p>
        	<p>Tested communication with node#1, by accessing the temperature sensor and getting it to report to COM port. The baud rate for COM communication through USB is 9600<p>
        	<p>Temperature is reporting back, but there seems to be some communication delay</p>

        	<p>Working at the embedded lab(FPAT), continued to troubleshoot communication issues with bench equipment.</p>
        	<p>Using the oscilloscope I found that the pins that are supposed to be set as high were indeed set as high, and pins that were supposed to be low were low. The rails where at the appropriate voltages for the logic stepper and the RFM break out. Node#3's RFM chip wasn't connected to ground and power. However this did not remedy the problem. Checking the TX or transmit pin on the Arduino, I could see that my messages were being encoded. Checking the interrupt pin showed that the RFM was indeed waking up when passed a command. However, hooking the oscilloscope to the clock on the RFM, we found that the clock would wake up, and get stuck in a loop after sending a message. Located the bit of code that causes this issue. When sending a packet with acknowledgement, it will continue to retry if it gets no response. The response is essential to the function of the system, the response is what ques the module to report to console signal strength and what node it's addressing. Signal strength is reported in negative db values from -1 to about -25. The smaller the db value, the closer that you are to the node. </p>
        	<p>Sprint meeting was also held in the lab. Demoed progress to the group, and explained wiring choices. Informed group of where I was stuck, the suggestion of using a spectrum analyzer to see if the radio modules were even broadcasting anything. Will consult Dr.Lump tomorrow on how I should proceed</p>

Tested max and minimum distance acceptable RSSI. The the max db value for two nodes been on top of each other is -25db. The maximum space that I could test was around 60 feet, its corresponding RSSI value was -80s db. Not sure if this is the limit of the RFM itself, space was too confined to test further</p>
