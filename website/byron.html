            <p>We could probably get away with just two cameras if we were to go this route but it really all depends on what we decide for the other parts of our system. Synergy is key to reduce cost and equipment. </p>
          <p>Speaking with Dr. Lump I found immediately that there are many options that we can explore to meet the design specifications. </p>
            <p>There are three main areas of concern that need to be addressed in the design of our system. First, is the tracking of the player, next is the tracking of the movement of the ball, and lastly is signal processing unit. </p>
            <p>For the tracking of the player there were a myriad of solutions. What immediately jumped to mind was indoor GPS. A quick search at Spark Fun or ADA Fruit turned up some results of packages ranging from $10 to over $100 that would be able to report positioning. The challenge with indoor GPS is that it’s tough to get heading and direction. Still this may be a cheap way of getting the XYZ coordinates of the players. </p>
            <p> Another option is, Computer Vision motion tracking. Computer Vision analyzes a series of images and report back motion and positioning information. There is an interesting article about Computer Vision motion tracking: </p> </br>
            http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/
            </br>
            <p>For the tracking of the ball, Computer Vision might be the best option, if we are trying to use a standard basketball. To make the system more accessible, it would be best to use as many standard parts as possible. Because of the nature of the game and the rapid movement of the ball, affixing a device to the ball may prove to be cumbersome. With Computer Vision, and a brightly colored ball, we would be able to track its movement in real time. This may be subject to change as we settle on the other parts of the system. </p>
            <p>Lastly is the signal processing unit or module that will be used to not only collect the data from the independent tracking devices, but also broadcast the information in such a way to be utilized by AndroidOS and iOS applications on each player’s phone. A nine axis sensor was suggested to communicate between a Computer/Arduino/Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC)/Raspberry Pi/ intel atom). If we want to do app development for this system, my recommendation is either the Raspberry pi or an Arduino. This is because of the pre-existing support. </p>
            <p>More information coming this weekend, where hopefully we can solidify the specifications for the system. </p>

			<p>in the interim since the last blog entry, I have met with Dr.Lump two more times. Once on Monday, September 5th, and again the following Wednesday, September 7th. Dr. Lump's assistance was invaluable, once the project scope solidified. I also plan on meeting him tomorrow Monday Sept 12th</p>

			<p>As a team we have decided to pursue position tracking through an RSSI or Receive Signal Strength Indicator. The RFM transceiver chosen was Spark Fun RFM69 Breakout (915MHz). This particular transceiver runs in the unlicensed ISM, or Industry, Science, and Medical band. The position tracking system had to meet several constraints to be applicable in our project. First, was accuracy. This transceiver is capable of broadcasting up to 50 meters through walls, also with a max 300kbps bit rate, we can update signal strength frequently. Second, it had to be able to report back to PC or microcontroller. For this the Arduino UNO was chosen to process the RF signal via serial connection. The Arduino can then in turn broadcast that data via serial COM port where we can then handle the data</p>

			<p>For the Arduino and the transceiver to communicate with one another, a logic level converter is needed. The Arduino Uno operates at 5V and it needs to be stepped down to the operating range of the transceiver</p>

			<p>In order to change this signal strength information into position information, we will have 4 beacons broadcasting on each side of the court. The player will also be carrying a transceiver. By taking a mean average of the relative signal strength of the player to the four beacons, a system of position can be established. </p>


			<p>each transceiver unit contains the following: A radio module, an Arduino Uno, a rechargeable Lithium polymer battery, Logic Level converter. Additional equipment such as breadboards and wires are included on the spread sheet.</p>

			<p>Next design concern is goal interaction.</p>

			<p>Today was our weekly sprint meeting. The objective was to solidify the Requirements specifications. Also to clear up operational specifications.</p>
			<p>I created half of the use cases. In particular, the follow five:</br></br>
				<ul>
					<li>User logs in</li>
					<li>User shoots ball</li>
					<li>User requests position</li>
					<li>User requests distance to basket</li>
					<li>User makes changes to settings</li>
				</ul>
			</p></br>
			<p>I was also in charge of creating the system block diagram. There are several moving parts for our system, so it was important to show not only how the pieces interact but also what is contained on each node. Flowcharts for the functionality were constructed in draw.io, All other charts designed in PowerPoint</p>
			<p>Time spent: 2.5 Hours</p>

			<p>Team meeting during class with Dr. Hayes. Talked about things tackled last week, things to do for this coming week, and challenges that we were encountering</p>
			<p>Besides, the materials covered in log 3, Last week I assembled to initial purchase list for the client</p>
			<p>For this next week, I plan on assembling the rest of the software libraries needed for each of the component pieces. Also, read the pin layout and hookup diagrams for the transceiver to Arduino connection. The equipment is expected to arrive this weekend and I want to be prepared.</p>
			<p>My biggest concern is scope. There are a lot of moving parts to this, and getting each one the elements to work together will be a challenge. I have seen tutorials of each individual part in action, functioning as prescribed, but indoor position tracking is still an engineering challenge</p>
			<p>For the purpose of clarity and documentation for the component build process, a video log will also be kept for the hardware. Camera: Canon PowerShot A4000: IS HD</p>
			<p>Time spent: 1 hour</p>
