Questions:
	- in what metric would they like to be told their position?
		- ex. x-feet from left side of court & y-feet from baseline
	- how important is it for them to know the direction of the goal?
		- explain our idea of "wearing glasses that tell the user the 
		  direction of the goal. Thoughts?
		- the reason I ask is because this is going to be the most
		  challenging to implement, but if it is worthy, we will put priority
		  on it
