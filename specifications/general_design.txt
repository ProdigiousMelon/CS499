Big picture design:
	- user is receiving information through their mobile device
	- the mobile device tells the user information through audio -- we picture
	  the user wearing a single earbud
	- mobile device is connect to a *central hub* microcontroller
	- *center hub* microcontroller is receiving/sending data from/to 
	  all other microcontrollers
		- other microcontrollers are collecting data useful to game

Note: currently, we envision Bluetooth being the form of communication between devices

Microcontrollers:
	- Raspberry Pi as central hub
	- all other microcontrollers are arduino's
		- three *distance microcontrollers* 
			- set up in a triangle to compute user coordinates
			- see positioning_system.txt
		- user micrcontroller
			- will receive/send Bluetooth packets from/to distance micrcontrollers ^^
		- backborad microcontroller
			- collecting data of where user shot landed
			- see backboard_system.txt
		- *throw-back* microcontroller
			- controls a servo motor connected to a hardware devise that
				throws the ball back to the shooter
			- servo motor is constantly swiveling to track shooter
			- this is only necessary when a single user is shooting
			- see throwback_system.txt
		- *glasses micrcontroller*
			- senses direction of the goal
