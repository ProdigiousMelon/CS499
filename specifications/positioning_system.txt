General requirement: 
	- mobile devices connect to a *central hub* microcontroller 
	- *central hub* microcontroller is connected to all other micrcontrollers
		- other microcontrollers are collecting data

Design:
	- sensors detect user position on the court
	- microcontroller sends coordinates to mobile device
	- mobile device tells user through earbud where they are on the court
		- type of coordinates up for debate? In other words, should the app
		  tell the user x-feet from the left side and y-feet from the baseline

Requirements:

	- must support multiple players
	- must calculate xy coordinates of the shooter on the court
	- must send position to mobile device
	- mobile device must tell user coordinates through audio

Current model:

	- three *distance sensors*
		- each sensor connects to shooter via bluetooth 
			- user is wearing a bluetooth sensor
		- each sensor is constantly emitting bluetooth packets
		- user's bluetooth sensor receives signal from sensor-x
		- user's bluetooth sends signal back to sensor-x
		- sensor-x calculates distance
		- sensor-x sends distance to central hub
	- central hub receives packets from all three distance sensors 
		- must identify packets that correspond to each user
		- in other word, each user has an ID
	- central hub triangulates position
	- central hub sends coordinates to mobile device via bluetooth
	- mobile device (of user-x) receives bluetooth packet
	- mobile device conveys coordinates via audio
		- user is wearing at least one earbud
